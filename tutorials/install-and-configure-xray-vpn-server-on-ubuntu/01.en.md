## Introduction

[Xray-Core] is a v2ray-core with XTLS support that helps you to bypass strong internet censorships like china's GFW.
In this tutorial we will install Xray-Core and configure it and use nginx as a reverse proxy for our VPN server. 

**Prerequisites**

* Ubuntu server 18.4 | 20.04 | 22.04
* Root access
* Domain name (Optional, recommended)

## Step 1 - Setup Xray-Core

First thing you need to do is to install the core executable. You can simply do that by executing below command:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -L https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-install/raw/main/install-release.sh)" @ install -u root
```

After that, the `xray` binary is installed in `/usr/local/bin/`. 

### Step 1.1 - Edit Xray-Core config file

Default configuration file is in `/usr/local/etc/xray/` directory, named `config.json`.
In this tutorial I'm using VLess + WS (Routing enabled) combination as my main inbound protocol, if you want to know
more about the configuration option or use other protocols, you can check bellow resources:

* [V2Ray Configuration](https://www.v2ray.com/en/configuration/) documentation.
* [Xray-examples](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-examples) repository, containing server and client configs for different protocols.

Now you need to edit the specified fields in this JSON config and then copy the config to `/usr/local/etc/xray/config.json` file.

```json
{
    "log": {
        "loglevel": "warning",
        "access": "PATH",  // E.g. /var/log/xray/access.log
        "error": "PATH"  // E.g. /var/log/xray/error.log
    },
    "inbounds": [
        {
            "port": 1080,
            "listen": "127.0.0.1",
            "protocol": "vless",
            "settings": {
                "clients": [
                    {
                        "id": "",  // Unique UUID
                        "email": ""  // Valid email address
                    }
                ],
                "decryption": "none"
            },
            "streamSettings": {
                "network": "ws",
                "wsSettings": {
                    "path": "/ray"  // Path for request handling (e.g wss://example.com/ray)
                }
            }
        }
    ],
    "outbounds": [
        {
            "protocol": "freedom"
        },
        {
            "protocol": "blackhole",
            "settings": {},
            "tag": "block"
        }
    ],
    "routing": {
        "domainStrategy": "AsIs",
        "rules": [
            {
                "type": "field",
                "outboundTag": "block",
                "protocol": [
                    "bittorrent" // Blocks bittorrent traffic
                ],
                "domain": [
                    "geosite:category-ads-all",  // Blocks all ads
                ],
                "ip": [
                    "geoip:private"  // Blocks private addresses like 127.0.0.1
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

### Step 1.2 - Start Xray service

Every time you edit xray's config file you must restart its service in order to apply the changes. You can do that like this:

```bash
service xray restart
```

Check xray service status:

```bash
service xray status
```

That will output something like this:

```
● xray.service - Xray Service
     Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/xray.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
    Drop-In: /etc/systemd/system/xray.service.d

   Main PID: 2676855 (xray)
      Tasks: 10 (limit: 4538)
     Memory: 19.5M
        CPU: 1min 26.983s
     CGroup: /system.slice/xray.service
             └─2676855 /usr/local/bin/xray run -config /usr/local/etc/xray/config.json

```

That's it! now our VPN server is up and running in localhost (since we set the `listen` field of our inbound protocol to `127.0.0.1`) and 
we need to pass incoming traffic to it using nginx reverse proxy. Let's begin!

## Step 2 - Installing Nginx

Because Nginx is available in Ubuntu’s default repositories, it is possible to install it from these repositories using the apt packaging system:

```bash
sudo apt install nginx
```

### Step 2.1 - Adjusting the Firewall

Before testing Nginx, the firewall software needs to be configured to allow access to the service. 
Nginx registers itself as a service with `ufw` upon installation, making it straightforward to allow Nginx access. 

List the application configurations that `ufw` knows how to work with by typing:

```bash
sudo ufw app list
```

You should get a listing of the application profiles:

```
Available applications:
  Nginx Full
  Nginx HTTP
  Nginx HTTPS
  OpenSSH
```

As demonstrated by the output, there are three profiles available for Nginx:

* **Nginx Full**: This profile opens both port 80 (normal, unencrypted web traffic) and port 443 (TLS/SSL encrypted traffic)
* **Nginx HTTP**: This profile opens only port 80 (normal, unencrypted web traffic)
* **Nginx HTTPS**: This profile opens only port 443 (TLS/SSL encrypted traffic)

It is recommended that you enable the most restrictive profile that will still allow the traffic you’ve configured.
Right now, we will only need to allow traffic on port 80.

You can enable this by typing:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP'
```

You can verify the change by typing:

```bash
sudo ufw status
```

The output will indicate which HTTP traffic is allowed:

```
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere                  
Nginx HTTP                 ALLOW       Anywhere                  
OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)             
Nginx HTTP (v6)            ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
```

### Step 2.2 - Check nginx status

```bash
service nginx status
```

Output:

```
● nginx.service - A high performance web server and a reverse proxy server
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Fri 2023-02-10 11:35:39 UTC; 2 days ago
       Docs: man:nginx(8)
    Process: 2676589 ExecReload=/usr/sbin/nginx -g daemon on; master_process on; -s reload (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
   Main PID: 1568880 (nginx)
      Tasks: 3 (limit: 4538)
     Memory: 11.7M
        CPU: 4min 33.882s
     CGroup: /system.slice/nginx.service
             ├─1568880 "nginx: master process /usr/sbin/nginx -g daemon on; master_process on;"
```

## Step 2.3 - Create Nginx config

In order for Nginx to serve our xray server, it’s necessary to create a server block with the correct directives.
Instead of modifying the default configuration file directly, let’s make a new one at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/xray.conf`:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/xray.conf
```

Paste in the following configuration block:

```nginx configuration
server { 
    listen 80;  # Since we're not using TLS alongside our Xray-Core, we serve it in plain HTTP
    server_name example.com;  # If you don't have a domain name that is behind a CDN, you can remove this directive
    location /ray {  # This path must be the same as the one you passed to your Xray-Core config
        if ($http_upgrade != "websocket") { 
            return 404;
        }
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:1080;  # Address and port of our Xray-Core server
        proxy_redirect off;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade; 
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade"; 
        proxy_set_header Host $host; 
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_read_timeout 52w;
    }
}
```

Next, let’s enable the file by creating a link from it to the sites-enabled directory, which Nginx reads from during startup:

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/xray.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/xray.conf
```

Now test to make sure that there are no syntax errors in any of our Nginx files:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

If there aren’t any problems, we can reload Nginx to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo service nginx reload
```

And we're officially done! everything's ready to connect to the server.

## Conclusion

Now that we have set everything up, we can connect to our server using different clients such as [V2RayN] for Windows or
[V2RayNG] for android by entering our Xray-Core server credentials (e.g. UUID, Address, etc.).
